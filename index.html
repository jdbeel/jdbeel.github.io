    I am a first year MS of Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, specializing in machine learning. 
    Before coming to Atlanta, I was working as a member of technical staff at RAM Laboratories in San Diego,
    where we did R&D pertaining to security, advanced analytics, modeling and simulation, and more. My contributions
    in particular include work on fuzzing, natural language processing, social media analysis, firmware analysis,
    and machine learning security.
