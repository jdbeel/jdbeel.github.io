The D&D community has put together some very helpful resources for us to use going forward. Firstly, there's a [computer-readable version of all of the SRD spells](https://github.com/tadzik/5e-spells). Since the first step of this exploration is just looking at spells, and no other aspects of D&D mechanics this is a great resource for us to use initially. Python handles JSON effortlessly so it's a no-brainer.

There's also this (REST API-accessible version of the SRD)[http://dnd5eapi.co] which has _all_ aspects that are available in the SRD, not just the spells. This will be great going forward in order to expand this system beyond just spells.

We'll be experimenting in Jupyter Notebooks using TensorFlow for neural nets. I tend to mix and match ML libraries depending on which is easier to implement what I'm trying to do, so that may change going forward.
